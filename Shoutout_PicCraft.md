# What is PicCraft?

PicCraft is an AI art generator app for non-English market.

<br/>

## What problem are we solving?

AI art generation is advancing and growing very fast this year, but there's a big problem about language.

The major AI art platforms require good English. Writing prompts in languages other than English produces bad or non-accurate result, because the platforms don't have the resources and time to re-train the engine. Plus, most of the UIs are in English and very hard to use with a lot of configurations. Many people just simply gave up after their first try.

PicCraft solves the problem by fine-tuning text-to-image AI models for non-english languages, resulting in 2.5x better prompt accuracy and 1.3x faster generation speed. With carefully designed and localized UIUX, we've turned complicated configurations and setups into a very simple but powerful app.

<br/>

## How far along are we?

My mom can teach her friends to create AI artworks in Chinese now.
We've been testing and iterating since March 2023. Our monthly active users has grown from 211 to 2,051 organically. 384K artworks have been created, 90% were created in Traditional Chinese.

<br/>

## Are the users willing to pay?

Yes. Our main goal in the past 3 months is to prove that our target users can generate revenue.
We've been testing our business models. As of August 2023 PicCraft has generated $538USD monthly recurring revenue from these 2K MAU.

<br/>

## What's our estimated market size?

The most successful AI art app Wombo Dream in the English language market has 6M MAU.
Our 2K MAU generates $500 USD monthly.
Assuming at their scale, the Service Obtainable Market (SOM) can be estimated to:
$500 * (6M/2K) * 12 = $18M

## Why am I making a pull request on Github?

Just like 541, I don't want to play defense; We are actively looking for resources and I want to stand out from others. Making a pull request might be a way to achieve the goal. Plus I think it'll be a cool metaphor that implies we will be adding value to 541.
