## How to reach out to us?

While we do read cold emails - all of them, we want you to understand that investors - including us, are looking for a signal that tells us that something is more important than others.  Warm intros are definitely one of the signals that urges us to take a meeting with the founders.  Therefore we strongly encourages you to find ways to get a warm intro to [Eunse](https://linkedin.com/in/eunse).
