# Our Ethos

541 Ventures believes in engineering the outcome.

At 541, this means we get in it with the founders as early as possible and work as if we're a co-founder to the company we're excited about to really guide them to grow as rapidly as possible to the growth stage and beyond.

Therefore we absolutely prefer to lead the earliest financing of the company and commit our resources to catalyze their growth.

Read [this](https://github.com/541VC/541/blob/main/Our_Thesis.md) for more on what we mean by high-tech, what we look for in founders and how we help catalyze their growth and engineer the outcome.

## Why is 541 Ventures on Github?

At 541, we doesn't play defence; we always play offence and we constantly seek better ways to be and stay close to deeply technical founders with disruptive visions.
In pursuing such founders that are potentially starting an industry, we have decided that Github is the best place for us to be to play offence.

## How to reach out to us?

We love meeting founders and hearing their exhilerating ideas! Too bad we just can't do it as much as we'd love to, because we - just like anyone else, only have 24 hours a day.
And this means we have to be very cautious about how we allocate the ultimately scarece resource - time, because we only have so much time that limits our bandwidth.
That's why we (investors) look for signals that tells us to give that someone a priority and get a meeting with her/him (badges from prestigeous accelerators or a great pedigree are nothing but such signals). And nothing makes us move faster than an intro from a trusted friend. For this, while we read the cold emails (like ALL of them), we strongly encourages you to find ways to get a warm intro to our Managing Partner [Eunse](https://linkedin.com/in/eunse).  Also, read this on how to get intros like a boss [here](http://eun5e.com/2022/02/how-to-get-intros-like-a-boss/).
