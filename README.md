# What is 541 Ventures?

541 Ventures is a Los Angeles-based VC that globally empowers extraordinary early-stage frontier-tech startups to start an industry, with at least one Asian (co-)founder. We do this because we don't just want to be a great investor but we aspire to be an iconic investor for Asian founders who are deeply technical and we invest in such deeply technical startups both in the US and in APAC ecosystems such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia.

# Our Ethos

541 Ventures believes in investing courageously.
At 541, this means we hold our nose up and get in it with the founders fron their earliest days, and support them to grow exponentially to their success.
For this, we're absolutely fearless to back the companies we love even when no one else does, and commit our resources to catalyze their growth.
Read [this](https://github.com/541VC/541/blob/main/Our_Thesis.md) for more on what we mean by frontier tech and what we look for in founders.

## Why is 541 Ventures on Github?

At 541, we don't play defense; we always play offense and we constantly seek better ways to be and stay close to the deeply technical founders who are potentially starting an industry. Therefore we have decided that Github is the best place for us to be and play offense.

## How can I reach out to 541?

We love meeting founders and hearing their exhilerating ideas! Too bad we just can't do it as much as we'd love to, because we - just like anyone else, only have 24 hours a day and we just have to be very wise about how we allocate our bandwidth, (writing a check is only a small portion of our bandwidth and the majority of our resources are in fact spent on supporting our companies).
What could be helpful is a signal that tells us to give your email a priority and compels us to get a meeting with you (badges from a prestigeous accelerator or a great pedigree are nothing but such signals). And nothing else than an intro from a trusted friend is a stronger signal that makes us move faster. Therefore, while we read cold emails (like ALL of them), we strongly encourage you to find ways to get an intro to our Managing Partner [Eunse](https://linkedin.com/in/eunse).
