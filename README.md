## How to reach out to us?

While we do read cold emails - all of them, we want you to understand that investors - including us, are looking for a signal that tells us that something is more important than the others.  And as you might guess, warm intros from people that we know well are definitely one of the strongest signals that urges us to take a meeting with the founders.  Therefore we strongly encourages you to find ways to get a warm intro to [Eunse](https://linkedin.com/in/eunse).
