* What do you mean by high-tech?

The dictionary definition of a high-tech is a proprietary technology that is protected by applicable laws.

We take a step further for our definition of high-tech.
To 541, high-tech is the fundamental technology being developed for the future that has not yet arrived, therefore no one else but you are building.

While we can't be right all the time, we believe at least we can be logical all the time.
If you can logically predict the future, see what it'll have to look like, and build something fundamental for what you've seen in that future - something so fundamental that everybody will have to use, and if we're excited about what you're seeing and building, we'll be absolutely fearless and proud to back you before everyone else.
