## What does 541 mean by high-tech?

The dictionary definition of a high-tech is a proprietary technology that is protected by applicable laws.

We take a few step further in our definition of high-tech.

541 Ventures defines high-tech as a fundamental technology being developed for the future that has not yet arrived, therefore no one else but you are building.
At 541, we put a very high value on the "fundamental" side of such technology so that the technology can be (and has to be) adopted and used by everyone when the future finally arrives.

## What does 541 want to see in founders?

Our baseline belief is that the great founders - especially for the ones who are deeply technical, are time travellers.

We believe that - while we can't be right all the time, we can at least be logical all the time.
From there, if you have your own insights, experience, knowledge and what not, and based on them if you can logically foresee the future before everone else, see what the future will have to look like, and travel back to the present and build something toward that future - something so fundamental that everybody will have to use it if you're right, we believe that it's our mission to empower you to go on and build that something and start the industry before everyone else.

Aonther belief that 541 upholds is that the best founders are capable of drawing their own axis in the existing framework so they have their own superpower.

99%+ of entrepreneurs define their place on a 2D competitive framework. They say things like "X-axis is the quality and Y-axis is the pricepoint.  If you look closely you'll find this space is untouched by anyone in the industry and we'll position ourselves just right there."

On the other hand, the rarer type of founders 541 is looking for are the ones that come to us and say, "These two axis are the factors that make up the industry today.  We want to draw this Z-axis of {{something}} so we can create and introduce a whole new set of values in the industry!  We turn the 2D framework into a 3D framework and that Z-axis which nobody else is building is going to be our superpower!"


If you're a time-traveller founder and capable of drawing you own axis, we believe you can potentially start an industry.  And if both of us are excited about the new industry you're starting, we'll be absolutely fearless and proud to back you, even before anyone else.
