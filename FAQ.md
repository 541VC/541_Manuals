### Is that Asian founder thing mandatory?

Yes, it is. 541 doesn't just want to be a great investor; we envision and strive to be an iconic investor for Asian founders in high-tech.
For this we focus on working with the companies with at least one Asian founder in an important role (CEO or CTO).

### Do you also invest in companies outside the United States?

Yes, we do have the capability and also the experience of investing in companies outside the US.
However, we do prefer to work with US companies or the companies that are flipping into the US because we believe that is the case where we can add more value and really help them grow rapidly.

### If flipping, do you want the company to be in LA?

Yes, we'd love to stay close to the companies so we can really be hands-on. On the other hand, you don't have to choose LA if you decide other place in the US is a better place for your company.

### Why LA?

For us, what better place chould there be to be an iconinc investor for Asian founders in high-tech?
LA has always been the major intersection between the US and Asia (and many other parts of the world).
Naturally, We have the iconic Koreatown (what's up, K-Town?), Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Thai Town, Little India and even Little Bangladesh!
LA is even where the largest number of Korean population resides outside Korea.

For companies, in addition to all of those above, LA is a great place as we produce the largest number of engineers (per our fellow LA-based investor [Mark Suster](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/08/theres-something-going-on-in-l-a/#:~:text=You%20may%20also%20be%20surprised,USC%2C%20UCLA%20and%20Harvey%20Mudd.)),
and we have a great tech ecosystem with the some of the world's most innovative companies like SpaceX, NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, Snap and so many incredible startups!
