### Is that Asian founder thing mandatory?

Yes, it is. 541 doesn't just want to be a great investor; we envision and strive to be an iconic investor for Asian founders in frontier tech.
For this we focus on working with the companies with at least one Asian founder in an important role (CEO or CTO).

### Do you also invest in companies outside the United States?

Yes, we have the capability and also the experience of investing in companies outside the US, especially from APAC ecosystems such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia.
However, we do prefer to partner with US startups or the APAC startups that are flipping into the US because we believe that we can best assist our startups in the US so they can grow rapidly.

### If flipping, do you want the company to be in LA?

Of course we'd love to stay close to our startups so we can provide full values. However, you don't have to choose LA if you've decided that other place in the US is a better place for your company.

### I'm working on a great idea! When's the best time to shout out to 541?

There are two answers for this question:

First, though we're constantly working hard to figure out ways to expedite our due diligence process, the current standard timeframe for our decision making is four weeks.
We don't just want to be a check-writer; we want to be in it with the founders, potentially for many years until they have a better lead investor than us.
Therefore it is critical for us to have the conviction that you are someone we want to get in trouble with and have fun with for many years.
We do appreciate some firms would give you a term sheet after two Zoom calls, but that's not 541.
We'd love to invest time for both of us to get to know each other and build the relationship so that we can form a solid conviction with each other.
So when you reach out to us, please expect at least four weeks.

Second, you just can't be too early to reach out to us, as we truly appreciate all the opportunities to get to know extraordinary founders and start building relationships with them because doing a startup is a long game that spans over many years and sometimes even longer than a decade. And when you raise VC for your company, it means you and the VC become partners for that long journey.

So, yes, it's possible that sometimes you're indeed too early to raise. Still, we are absolutely pleased to invest time to get to know you and help you in any way we could until we finally end up on your captable.

### Why LA?

For us, what better place could there be than LA to build an iconinc investor for Asian founders in high-tech?
LA has always been a significant intersection between the US and Asia (and many other parts of the world).
Naturally, we have the iconic Koreatown (what's up, K-Town?), Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Thai Town, Little India and even Little Bangladesh!
LA is even where the largest number of Korean population resides outside Korea.

For companies, in addition to all of those above, LA is a great place as we produce the largest number of engineers (per our fellow LA-based investor [Mark Suster](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/08/theres-something-going-on-in-l-a/#:~:text=You%20may%20also%20be%20surprised,USC%2C%20UCLA%20and%20Harvey%20Mudd.)),
and we have a great tech ecosystem with the some of the world's most innovative companies like SpaceX, NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, Snap and so many incredible startups!
