### Is that Asian founder thing mandatory?

Yes, it is. 541 doesn't just want to be a great investor; we envision and strive to be an iconic investor for Asian founders in high-tech.
For this we focus on working with the companies with at least one Asian founder in an important role (CEO or CTO).

### Do you also invest in companies outside the United States?

Yes, we have the capability and also the experience of investing in companies outside the US.
However, we do prefer to work with US companies or the companies that are flipping into the US because we believe that is the case where we can add more value and really help them grow rapidly.

### If flipping, do you want the company to be in LA?

Yes, we'd love to stay close to the companies so we can really be hands-on. On the other hand, you don't have to choose LA if you decide other place in the US is a better place for your company.

### I'm working on a great idea! When's the best time to shout out to 541?

There are two answers for this question:

First, though we're constantly working hard to figure out ways to expedite our due diligence process, the current standard timeframe for our due diligence is four weeks.
We don't just want to be a check-writer; we want to be in it with the founders, potentially for many years until they have a better lead investor.
Therefore it is critical for us to have the conviction that you are someone we want to get in trouble with and have fun with for many years.
We do appreciate some firms would give you a term sheet after two Zoom calls, but that's not 541.
It will take at least some time for both of us to build the relationship that forms that conviction.
So when you reach out to us, please expect at least four weeks.

Second, you just can't be too early to reach out to us, as we truly appreciate the opportunity to get to know you and start building the relationship with you.
Starting up and growing a company is not a sprint - it's a long game that spans over many years and sometimes even longer than a decade.
And when you raise VC for your company, you're in fact getting a partner for that long journey.
Yes, it's possible that sometimes you're indeed too early to raise. Still, we are absolutely pleased to invest time to get to know you and help in any way we could until we finally end up on your captable.

### Why LA?

For us, what better place chould there be to be an iconinc investor for Asian founders in high-tech?
LA has always been a significant intersection between the US and Asia (and many other parts of the world).
Naturally, we have the iconic Koreatown (what's up, K-Town?), Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Thai Town, Little India and even Little Bangladesh!
LA is even where the largest number of Korean population resides outside Korea.

For companies, in addition to all of those above, LA is a great place as we produce the largest number of engineers (per our fellow LA-based investor [Mark Suster](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/08/theres-something-going-on-in-l-a/#:~:text=You%20may%20also%20be%20surprised,USC%2C%20UCLA%20and%20Harvey%20Mudd.)),
and we have a great tech ecosystem with the some of the world's most innovative companies like SpaceX, NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, Snap and so many incredible startups!
