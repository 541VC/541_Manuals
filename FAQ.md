### Is that Asian founder thing mandatory?

Yes, it is. 541 doesn't just want to be a great investor; we envision and strive to be an iconic investor for Asian founders in frontier tech.
For this we focus on working with the companies with at least one Asian founder in an important role (CEO or CTO).

### Do you also invest in companies outside the United States?

While we do have the capability and also the experience of investing in companies outside the US, especially in the APAC ecosystems such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia and we want to meet the most talented and deeply techincal founders from such geographies, we are focused on the founders that are coming to the US to build great companies from such APAC ecosystems as well as the US companies with at least one Asian co-founder, as we believe we can best support US-based companies.

### If I move my company to US, do we have to end up in LA?

Of course we'd love to stay close to our startups so we can provide full values and WE LOVE LA! However, our founders have a total freedom to choose where they want to be. We just want such decision to be based on a logically reasoning.

### I'm working on a great idea! When's the best time to shout out to 541?

There are two answers for this question:

First, you just can't be too early to reach out to us, as we truly appreciate all the opportunities to get to know extraordinary founders and start building relationships with them because doing a startup is a long game that spans over many years and sometimes even longer than a decade. And when you raise VC for your company, it means you and the VC become partners for that long journey.

So, yes, it's possible that sometimes you're indeed too early to raise. Still, we are absolutely pleased to invest time to get to know you and help you in any way we could until we finally end up on your captable.

Second, though we're constantly working hard to figure out ways to expedite our due diligence process, the current standard timeframe for our decision making is about four weeks.
We do know that there are some firms that would give you a term sheet after two Zoom calls. Unfortunately, that's not how we do it at 541.
We don't just want to be a check-writer; we want to be in it with the founders, potentially for many years until they have a better lead investor than us.
For this, we love to invest time to get to know each other and build a relationship with the founders so we can form a solid conviction that they are someone we want to get in trouble with and have fun with for a long time.

So when you reach out to us, please expect at least four weeks to the term sheet.

### Why LA?

For us, what better place could there be than LA to build an iconinc investor for Asian founders in high-tech?

LA has always been a significant intersection between the US and Asia (and many other parts of the world).
Naturally, we have the iconic Koreatown (what's up, K-Town?), Little Tokyo, Chinatown, Thai Town, Little India and even Little Bangladesh!
LA is even where the largest number of Korean population resides outside Korea.
And of course, food is GREAT!

For fouunders, the fact that LA has such diverse and vibrant munticultural universe of communities allows a softer landing - regardless of where they're coming from, and makes their initial days so much easier so they can entirely focusn on building the foundation for an increadible company.

For companies, in addition to all of those cool things above, LA is a great place as we produce the largest number of engineers (per our fellow LA-based investor [Mark Suster](https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/08/theres-something-going-on-in-l-a/#:~:text=You%20may%20also%20be%20surprised,USC%2C%20UCLA%20and%20Harvey%20Mudd.)),
and we have a great tech ecosystem with the some of the world's most innovative companies like SpaceX, NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, Snap and so many incredible startups!
